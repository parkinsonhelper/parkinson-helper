### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests! Hereâ€™s how to submit one:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes** in a new git branch.
3.  **Follow the coding style** described below.
4.  **Ensure your code builds and runs** without errors or warnings.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message.

## Coding Style Guidelines (Swift)

*   **Clarity is Key:** Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
*   **SwiftUI Best Practices:** Use SwiftUI's declarative syntax. Avoid mixing in UIKit unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Safety First:** Avoid force unwrapping (`!`). Use `guard let` or `if let` to safely unwrap optionals.
*   **Localization:** All user-facing strings must be added to the appropriate `.strings` files. Do not hardcode text in the views.
*   **Comments:** Use comments to explain *why* you did something, not *what* you did. Complex logic deserves a clear explanation.
*   **Adhere to Project Conventions:** Look at the existing code and try to match its style and structure.

Thank you again for your contribution!
